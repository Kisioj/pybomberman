    Note that sleeping in some procedures results in the return value being
    lost. For example, if you sleep inside Enter() or Exit(), it will be as

    Also be aware, that a sleeping procedure whose src object gets deleted
    will automatically terminate when execution returns to it. This is to
    protect you against trying to access properties or procedures of a
    deleted (and therefore null) object. If you do not want the procedure
    to be terminated, you should set src to null.

    is an infinite loop that performs some periodic operation.
